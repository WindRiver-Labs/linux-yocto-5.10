	depends on ARM64 && PCI
	default y
	help
	  Select this option to enable the PCI console driver when OcteonTX2
	  is configured as an Endpoint.  This allows the host [PC] to connect
	  to the Linux console via PCI (using the host remote console utility).
	  To enable this console, specify 'console=pci0' on the kernel
	  command line.
	  To compile this as a module, choose M here.  However, when used
	  as a module, some kernel boot messages may be missing from the
	  console.

config OCTEONTX2_PCI_CONSOLE_DEBUG
	bool "OcteonTX2 PCI Endpoint console driver verbose debug messages"
	depends on OCTEONTX2_PCI_CONSOLE
	help
	  Say Y here if you want the OcteonTX2 PCI console driver
	  to write verbose debug messages to the system log.  Select this
	  if you are having a problem with the OcteonTX2 PCI console
	  and want to see more details of the console's operation.

	  If you are unsure about this, say N here.

config GTI_WATCHDOG
	tristate "GTI Watchdog driver"
	depends on ARM64
	help
	GTI Watchdog driver, provides ioctl's for applications to
	setup and enable the NMI Watchdog and also provides
	an mmap() interface to map GTI device memory into process
	address space for the application to directly poke the
	GTI watchdog without any kernel support and entry.

config OCTEONTX2_LLC
	bool "OcteonTX2 LLC Manager driver"
	depends on ARM64
	default y
	help
	  This driver offers cache management interface for
	  Marvell's OcteonTX2 LLC cache Lock and Unlock operations.

config OCTEONTX_INFO
       tristate "OcteonTX Info driver"
	depends on PROC_FS
	help

	  PHY drivers to access Marvell's MDIO bus.

config MRVL_PHY_DIAGNOSTICS
	tristate "Marvell PHY diagnostics debugfs driver"
	default m
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Select this option if you want an additional interface for
	  extended diagnostics functions for the PHY. This complements
	  functionality offered by ethtool. Requires PHY driver support in ATF.

config MARVELL_CN10K_SERDES_DIAGNOSTICS
