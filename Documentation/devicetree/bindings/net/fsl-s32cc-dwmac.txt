* NXP S32G/R GMAC ethernet controller

This device is a platform glue layer for stmmac.
Please see stmmac.txt for the other unchanged properties.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be the following string:
		"fsl,s32cc-dwmac"
- reg: two tuples are required:
  1) address and length of the register set for the device.
  2) address and length of the MAC control register
- interrupts: interrupt for the device
- interrupt-names: must be "macirq"
- clocks: A phandle to the reference clock for this device
- clock-names: must be "stmmaceth" and "pclk"
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt
- phy-handle: See ethernet.txt

Optional child node of emac:
- mdio bus node: should be named mdio with compatible "snps,dwmac-mdio"

The device node referenced by "phy" or "phy-handle" must be a child node
of the mdio node. See phy.txt for the generic PHY bindings.

Example:
gmac0: ethernet@4033c000 {
	compatible = "fsl,s32cc-dwmac";
	reg = <0x0 0x4033c000 0x0 0x2000>, /* gmac IP */
	      <0x0 0x4007C004 0x0 0x4>;    /* S32 CTRL_STS reg */
	interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
	interrupts = <0 57 4>;
	interrupt-names = "macirq";
	tx-fifo-depth = <20480>;
	rx-fifo-depth = <20480>;
	clocks = <&clks S32GEN1_CLK_XBAR>, <&clks S32GEN1_CLK_XBAR>,
		     <&clks S32GEN1_CLK_GMAC_0_TX>;
	clock-names = "stmmaceth", "pclk", "tx";
	phy-handle = <&rgmii_phy>;
	phy-mode = "rgmii";
	gmac0_mdio: mdio0 {
		compatible = "snps,dwmac-mdio";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		rgmii_phy: ethernet-phy@1 {
			reg = <1>;
		};
	};
};
