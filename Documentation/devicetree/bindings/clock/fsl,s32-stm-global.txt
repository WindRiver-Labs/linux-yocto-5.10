NXP STM timer used as universal time source

This STM timer driver is designed to be used as universal time source
for S32 Gen1 SoCs.

Required properties:
- compatible : "fsl,s32gen1-stm-global"
- reg : Should contain 1 register range(address and length)

Example:

stm0: stm@4000D000{
	compatible = "fsl,s32gen1-stm-global";
	reg = <0x0 0x4000D000 0x0 0x1000>;
	clock-names = "stm";
	status = "disabled";
};

&stm0 {
	status = "okay";
};
