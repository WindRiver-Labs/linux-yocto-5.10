* NXP S32 PCIe interface *

This PCIe host controller is based on the Synopsys DesignWare PCIe IP
and thus inherits all the common properties defined in designware-pcie.txt.

Required properties:
- compatible:
	- "fsl,s32v234-pcie", for S32V234 SoCs
	- "fsl,s32gen1-pcie", for S32Gen1 SoCs RC mode
	- "fsl,s32gen1-pcie-ep", for S32Gen1 SoCs EP mode
- reg: base address and length of the PCIe controller
- interrupts: A list of interrupt outputs of the controller. Must contain an
  entry for each item in the interrupt-names property.
- interrupt-names: Must include the following entries:
	- "msi": The interrupt that is asserted when an MSI is received
Optional:
- msi-parent: Use this option pointing to the GIC controller node which will
  handle the MSIs. This property can be used only in Root Complex case.
  By default, MSIs are handled by iMSI-RX -Integrated MSI Receiver [AXI Bridge]-,
  an integrated MSI reception module in AXI Bridge which detects and terminates
  inbound MSI requests (received on the RX wire). These MSIs will no longer appear
  on the AXI bus. The disadvantage of this approach is that only one hardware
  interrupt can be used, the one named "msi" from the interrupt list, which will
  make impossible MSIs balancing between several cores.
  If one wants to use more than one hardware interrupt, iMSI-RX should be skipped
  and MSIs should be generated as SPIs.
  This can be achived by adding the "msi-parent" property. The msi-parent
  should be declared as "msi-controller" and the list of available SPIs that
  can be used will be declared using "mbi-ranges".

Example:

	pcie: pcie@0x72000000 {
		compatible = "fsl,s32v234-pcie";
		reg = <0 0x72ffc000 0 0x4000>, <0 0x72f00000 0 0x80000>;
		reg-names = "dbi", "config";
		#address-cells = <3>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
		device_type = "pci";
		ranges = <0x81000000 0 0          0 0x72f80000 0 0x00010000 /* downstream I/O */
			  0x82000000 0 0x72000000 0 0x72000000 0 0x00f00000>; /* non-prefetchable memory */
		num-lanes = <1>;
		bus-range = <0x0 0xff>;
		interrupts =  <0 103 4>, <0 104 4>, <0 105 4>;
		interrupt-names = "link_req_rst_not", "dma","msi";
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
		interrupt-map-mask = <0 0 0 0x7>;
		interrupt-map = <0 0 0 1 &gic 0 108 4>,
				<0 0 0 2 &gic 0 107 4>,
				<0 0 0 3 &gic 0 106 4>,
				<0 0 0 4 &gic 0 105 4>;

		/* msi-parent = <&gic>; */
		status = "disabled";
	};
