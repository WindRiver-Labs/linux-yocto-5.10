* Freescale SIUL2 iomux controller

See chapter 20 ("System Integration Unit Lite2 (SIUL2)") in the reference
manual[1].

Based on fsl,imx-pincontrol implementation.

Required properties:
- compatible:
	* "fsl,s32v234-siul2-pinctrl"
	  Latest version.
	* "fsl,s32v234-siul2" <DEPRECATED>
	  Backward compatible string for the use cases
	  when the user boots kernel with an old device tree. It's not
	  recommended to use it anymore.
- fsl,pins: two integers array, represents a group of pins mux and config
  setting. The format is fsl,pins = <PIN_FUNC_ID CONFIG>
  PIN_FUNC_ID - id of MSCR to be modified
  CONFIG - configuration to be written in the MSCR/IMCR register

  Even though IMCR register should be used as input register, it can be
  set and addressed in the same way as MSCR, only instead of passing the
  IMCR index, IMCR_IDX + 512 is passed[1].

  Some pads can be configured only through SRC_GPR regitsters. If this is
  the case, PIN_FUNC_ID will be obtained from SRC_GPR index and the offset
  in the register using S32V234_PAD_GPR macro:
	* S32V234_PAD_GPR(n, m) will address bit m from SRC_GPRn.
  CONFIG can be 1 or 0 in SRC_GPR case.
  Eg:
	#define S32V234_PAD_GPR8__SPI0_SCK_IN	\
			S32V234_PAD_GPR(8, 31) S32V234_PAD_GPR_EN
